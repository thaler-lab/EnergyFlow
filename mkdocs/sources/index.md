## Features

EnergyFlow is a Python package containing a suite of particle physics tools:

- [Energy Flow Polynomials](docs/efp): EFPs are a collection of jet substructure observables which form a complete linear basis of IRC-safe observables. EnergyFlow provides tools to compute EFPs on events for several energy and angular measures as well as custom measures.
<br><br>
- [Energy Flow Networks](docs/archs): EFNs are infrared- and collinear-safe models designed for learning from collider events as unordered, variable-length sets of particles. EnergyFlow contains customizable Keras implementations of EFNs. Available from version `0.10.0` onward.
<br><br>
- [Particle Flow Networks](docs/archs): PFNs are general models designed for learning from collider events as unordered, variable-length sets of particles, based on the [Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) framework. EnergyFlow contains customizable Keras implementations of PFNs. Available from version `0.10.0` onward.
<br><br>
- [Energy Mover's Distance](docs/emd): The EMD is a common metric between probability distributions that has been adapted for use as a metric between collider events. EnergyFlow contains code to facilitate the computation of the EMD between events based on an underlying implementation provided by the [Python Optimal Transport (POT)](https://pot.readthedocs.io) library. Available from version `0.11.0` onward.
<br><br>
- [Energy Flow Moments](docs/efm): EFMs are moments built out of particle energies and momenta that can be evaluated in linear time in the number of particles. They provide a highly efficient means of implementing $\beta=2$ EFPs and are also very useful for reasoning about linear redundancies that appear between EFPs. Available from version `1.0.0` onward.

The EnergyFlow package also provides easy access to particle phyiscs datasets and useful supplementary features:

- [CMS Open Data in MOD HDF5 Format](docs/datasets/#cms-open-data-and-the-mod-hdf5-format): Reprocessed datasets from the [CMS Open Data](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-guide-for-research), currently including jets with $p_T>375$ GeV and associated detector-level and generator-level Monte Carlo samples. EnergyFlow provides tools for downloading, reading, and manipulating these datasets.
<br><br>
- [Jet Tagging Datasets](docs/datasets/#quark-and-gluon-jets): Datasets of Pythia 8 and Herwig 7.1 simulated quark and gluon jets are provided, along with tools for downloading and reading them.
<br><br>
- [Additional Architectures](docs/archs): Implementations of other architectures useful for particle physics are also provided, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for jet images.
<br><br>
- [Demos](demos): Jupyter notebook demos that can run in your browser (without any installation) via [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
<br><br>
- [Detailed Examples](examples): Examples showcasing EFPs, EFNs, PFNs, EMDs, and more.


The current version is `1.3.3a0`. Changes are summarized in the [Release Notes](releases). Using the most up-to-date version is recommended. As of version `0.7.0`, tests have been written covering the majority of the EFP and EMD code. The architectures code is currently tested by running the examples. The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pkomiske/EnergyFlow).
