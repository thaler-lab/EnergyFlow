# Architectures

Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) and Particle Flow Networks (PFNs) are model
architectures designed for learning from collider events as unordered,
variable-length sets of particles. Both EFNs and PFNs are parameterized by a
learnable per-particle function $\Phi$ and latent space function $F$.

An EFN takes the following form:

$$\text{EFN}=F\left(\sum_{i=1}^M z_i \Phi(\hat p_i)\right)$$

where $z_i$ is a measure of the energy of particle $i$, such as $z_i=p_{T,i}$,
and $\hat p_i$ is a measure of the angular information of particle $i$, such as
$\hat p_i = (y_i,\phi_i)$. Any infrared- and collinear-safe observable can be
parameterized in this form.

A PFN takes the following form:

$$\text{PFN}=F\left(\sum_{i=1}^M \Phi(p_i)\right)$$

where $p_i$ is the information of particle $i$, such as its four-momentum,
charge, or flavor. Any observable can be parameterized in this form. See the
[Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) framework for additional
discussion.

Since these architectures are not used by the core EnergyFlow code, and require
the external [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [scikit-learn](http:
//scikit-learn.org/) libraries, they are not imported by default but must be
explicitly imported, e.g. `from energyflow.archs import *`. EnergyFlow also
contains several additional model architectures for ease of using common models
that frequently appear in the intersection of particle physics and machine
learning.

----

## ArchBase

Base class for all architectures contained in EnergyFlow. The mechanism of
specifying hyperparameters for all architectures is described here. Methods
common to all architectures are documented here. Note that this class cannot
be instantiated directly as it is an abstract base class.

```python
energyflow.archs.archbase.ArchBase(*args, **kwargs)
```

Accepts arbitrary arguments. Positional arguments (if present) are
dictionaries of hyperparameters, keyword arguments (if present) are
hyperparameters directly. Keyword hyperparameters take precedence over
positional hyperparameter dictionaries.

**Arguments**

- ***args** : arbitrary positional arguments
    - Each argument is a dictionary containing hyperparameter (name, value)
    pairs.
- ***kwargs** : arbitrary keyword arguments
    - Hyperparameters as keyword arguments. Takes precedence over the
    positional arguments.

**Default NN Hyperparameters**

Common hyperparameters that apply to all architectures except for
[`LinearClassifier`](#linearclassifier).

**Compilation Options**

- **loss**=`'categorical_crossentropy'` : _str_
    - The loss function to use for the model. See the [Keras loss
    function docs](https://keras.io/losses/) for available loss
    functions.
- **optimizer**=`'adam'` : Keras optimizer or _str_
    - A [Keras optimizer](https://keras.io/optimizers/) instance or a
    string referring to one (in which case the default arguments are
    used).
- **metrics**=`['accuracy']` : _list_ of _str_
    - The [Keras metrics](https://keras.io/metrics/) to apply to the
    model.
- **compile_opts**=`{}` : _dict_
    - Dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed on to the
    [`compile`](https://keras.io/models/model/#compile) method of the
    model. `loss`, `optimizer`, and `metrics` (see above) are included
    in this dictionary. All other values are the Keras defaults.

**Output Options**

- **output_dim**=`2` : _int_
    - The output dimension of the model.
- **output_act**=`'softmax'` : _str_ or Keras activation
    - Activation function to apply to the output.

**Callback Options**

- **filepath**=`None` : _str_
    - The file path for where to save the model. If `None` then the
    model will not be saved.
- **save_while_training**=`True` : _bool_
    - Whether the model is saved during training (using the
    [`ModelCheckpoint`](https://keras.io/callbacks/#modelcheckpoint)
    callback) or only once training terminates. Only relevant if
    `filepath` is set.
- **save_weights_only**=`False` : _bool_
    - Whether only the weights of the model or the full model are
    saved. Only relevant if `filepath` is set.
- **modelcheck_opts**=`{'save_best_only':True, 'verbose':1}` : _dict_
    - Dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed on to the
    [`ModelCheckpoint`](https://keras.io/callbacks/#modelcheckpoint)
    callback, if it is present. `save_weights_only` (see above) is
    included in this dictionary. All other arguments are the Keras
    defaults.
- **patience**=`None` : _int_
    - The number of epochs with no improvement after which the training
    is stopped (using the [`EarlyStopping`](https://keras.io/
    callbacks/#earlystopping) callback). If `None` then no early stopping
    is used.
- **earlystop_opts**=`{'restore_best_weights':True, 'verbose':1}` : _dict_
    - Dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed on to the
    [`EarlyStopping`](https://keras.io/callbacks/#earlystopping)
    callback, if it is present. `patience` (see above) is included in
    this dictionary. All other arguments are the Keras defaults.

**Flags**

- **name_layers**=`True` : _bool_
    - Whether to give the layers of the model explicit names or let
    them be named automatically. One reason to set this to `False`
    would be in order to use parts of this model in another model
    (all Keras layers in a model are required to have unique names).
- **compile**=`True` : _bool_
    - Whether the model should be compiled or not.
- **summary**=`True` : _bool_
    - Whether a summary should be printed or not.

### fit

```python
fit(*args, **kwargs)
```

Train the model by fitting the provided training dataset and labels.
Transparently calls the `.fit()` method of the underlying model.

**Arguments**

- ***args** : _numpy.ndarray_ or _tensorflow.data.Dataset_
    - Either the `X_train` and `Y_train` NumPy arrays or a TensorFlow
    dataset.
- **kwargs** : _dict_
    - Keyword arguments passed on to the `.fit()` method of the
    underlying model. Most relevant for neural network models, where the
    [TensorFlow/Keras model docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/
    python/tf/keras/Model#fit) contain detailed information on the
    possible arguments.

**Returns**

- The return value of the the underlying model's `.fit()` method.

### predict

```python
predict(X_test, **kwargs)
```

Evaluate the model on a dataset. Note that for the `LinearClassifier`
this corresponds to the `predict_proba` method of the underlying
scikit-learn model.

**Arguments**

- **X_test** : _numpy.ndarray_
    - The dataset to evaluate the model on.
- **kwargs** : _dict_
    - Keyword arguments passed on to the underlying model when
    predicting on a dataset.

**Returns**

- _numpy.ndarray_
    - The value of the model on the input dataset.

### properties

#### model

```python
model
```

The underlying model held by this architecture. Note that accessing
an attribute that the architecture does not have will resulting in
attempting to retrieve the attribute from this model. This allows for
interrogation of the EnergyFlow architecture in the same manner as the
underlying model.

**Examples**

- For neural network models:
    - `model.layers` will return a list of the layers, where
    `model` is any EnergFlow neural network.
- For linear models:
    - `model.coef_` will return the coefficients, where `model`
    is any EnergyFlow `LinearClassifier` instance.

    - The number of features for each particle.
- **Phi_sizes** (formerly `ppm_sizes`) : {_tuple_, _list_} of _int_
    - The sizes of the dense layers in the per-particle frontend
    module $\Phi$. The last element will be the number of latent
    observables that the model defines.
- **F_sizes** (formerly `dense_sizes`) : {_tuple_, _list_} of _int_
    - The sizes of the dense layers in the backend module $F$.

**Default EFN Hyperparameters**

- **Phi_acts**=`'relu'` (formerly `ppm_acts`) : {_tuple_, _list_} of
_str_ or Keras activation
    - Activation functions(s) for the dense layers in the
    per-particle frontend module $\Phi$. A single string or activation
    layer will apply the same activation to all layers. Keras advanced
    activation layers are also accepted, either as strings (which use
    the default arguments) or as Keras `Layer` instances. If passing a
    single `Layer` instance, be aware that this layer will be used for
    all activations and may introduce weight sharing (such as with
    `PReLU`); it is recommended in this case to pass as many activations
    as there are layers in the model. See the [Keras activations
    docs](https://keras.io/activations/) for more detail.
- **F_acts**=`'relu'` (formerly `dense_acts`) : {_tuple_, _list_} of
_str_ or Keras activation
    - Activation functions(s) for the dense layers in the
    backend module $F$. A single string or activation layer will apply
    the same activation to all layers.
- **Phi_k_inits**=`'he_uniform'` (formerly `ppm_k_inits`) : {_tuple_,
_list_} of _str_ or Keras initializer
    - Kernel initializers for the dense layers in the per-particle
    frontend module $\Phi$. A single string will apply the same
    initializer to all layers. See the [Keras initializer docs](https:
    //keras.io/initializers/) for more detail.
- **F_k_inits**=`'he_uniform'` (formerly `dense_k_inits`) : {_tuple_,
_list_} of _str_ or Keras initializer

    module $F$. A single string will apply the same initializer
    to all layers.
- **latent_dropout**=`0` : _float_
    - Dropout rates for the summation layer that defines the
    value of the latent observables on the inputs. See the [Keras
    Dropout layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout) for more
    detail.
- **F_dropouts**=`0` (formerly `dense_dropouts`) : {_tuple_, _list_}
of _float_
    - Dropout rates for the dense layers in the backend module $F$.
    A single float will apply the same dropout rate to all dense layers.
- **Phi_l2_regs**=`0` : {_tuple_, _list_} of _float_
    - $L_2$-regulatization strength for both the weights and biases
    of the layers in the $\Phi$ network. A single float will apply the
    same $L_2$-regulatization to all layers.
- **F_l2_regs**=`0` : {_tuple_, _list_} of _float_

    - The value for which particles with all features set equal to
    this value will be ignored. The [Keras Masking layer](https://
    keras.io/layers/core/#masking) appears to have issues masking
    the biases of a network, so this has been implemented in a
    custom (and correct) manner since version `0.12.0`.
- **num_global_features**=`None` : _int_
    - Number of additional features to be concatenated with the latent
    space observables to form the input to F. If not `None`, then the
    features are to be provided at the end of the list of inputs.

### eval_filters

```python
eval_filters(patch, n=100, prune=True)
```

Evaluates the latent space filters of this model on a patch of the
two-dimensional geometric input space.

**Arguments**

- **patch** : {_tuple_, _list_} of _float_
    - Specifies the patch of the geometric input space to be evaluated.
    A list of length 4 is interpretted as `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`.
    Passing a single float `R` is equivalent to `[-R,-R,R,R]`.
- **n** : {_tuple_, _list_} of _int_
    - The number of grid points on which to evaluate the filters. A list
    of length 2 is interpretted as `[nx, ny]` where `nx` is the number of
    points along the x (or first) dimension and `ny` is the number of points
    along the y (or second) dimension.
- **prune** : _bool_
    - Whether to remove filters that are all zero (which happens sometimes
    due to dying ReLUs).

**Returns**

- (_numpy.ndarray_, _numpy.ndarray_, _numpy.ndarray_)
    - Returns three arrays, `(X, Y, Z)`, where `X` and `Y` have shape `(nx, ny)`
    and are arrays of the values of the geometric inputs in the specified patch.
    `Z` has shape `(num_filters, nx, ny)` and is the value of the different
    filters at each point.
