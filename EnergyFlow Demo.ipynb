    "### Energy Flow Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce the EnergyFlow package for computing arbitrary Energy Flow Polynomials (EFPs) and collections of EFPs. The package is built with both usability, flexibility, and computational efficiency in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of $M$ particles with energy measure $z_i$ and pairwise angular distance measures $\\theta_{ij}$, the EFPs are multiparticle energy correlator observables, indexed by multigraphs $G$, and defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{EFP}_G = \\sum_{i_1=1}^M \\sum_{i_2=1}^M\\cdots \\sum_{i_N=1}^M z_{i_1}z_{i_2}\\cdots z_{i_N} \\prod_{(k,\\ell)\\in G} \\theta_{i_ki_\\ell},$$\n",
    "where $(k,\\ell)\\in G$ iterates over the edges in the multigraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choices of Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific choice of energy and angular measures depends on the collider context. We provide the following `measure` options (default is `hadrdot`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`hadr`: $$ z_i = p_{T,i}^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = ((y_i - y_j)^2 + (\\phi_i - \\phi_j)^2)^{\\beta/2} $$\n",
    "`hadrdot`: $$ z_i = p_{T,i}^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = (2\\, \\hat p_i^\\mu \\hat p_{i\\,\\mu})^{\\beta/2},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{where }\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\hat p_i^\\mu \\equiv p_i^\\mu/p_{T,i}  $$\n",
    "`ee`: $$ z_i = E_i^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = (2\\, \\hat p_i^\\mu \\hat p_{i\\,\\mu})^{\\beta/2},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{where }\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\hat p_i^\\mu \\equiv p_i^\\mu/E_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy and angular weighting parameters `kappa` and `beta` default to $\\kappa=1$ and $\\beta = 2$. The choice of $\\kappa = 1$ is required for infrared and collinear (IRC) safety of the observables. Any choice of $\\beta > 0$ guarantees IRC safety. We also provide the `normed` option (default is `True`) to use a normalized and dimensionless energy measure $z_i/\\sum_{j=1}^M z_j$ rather than $z_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this refresher, we have enough to begin using EnergyFlow to compute arbitrary EFPs! Ensure you have EnergyFlow installed. It is easily `pip` installable by executing:\n",
    "` pip install energyflow `\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the EnergyFlow package as well as some other helpful Python libraries."

It returns `nevents` events consisting of `nparticles` massless four-momenta with center of mass energy of `energy` in the center of momentum frame.

Now you should be able to specify any EFP (i.e. multigraph) or set of EFPs that you want to comput with `EFP` or `EFPSet`, compute them on a set of events with `compute` or `batch_compute`, and study the results with `specs` and `graphs`!
